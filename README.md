## Usage

Install package
```
composer require byteit/openapi-spec-generator
```

Publish the config file

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="LaravelJsonApi\OpenApiSpec\OpenApiServiceProvider"
```

Generate the Open API spec
```
php artisan jsonapi:openapi:generate v1
```
Note that a seeded DB is required! The seeded data will be used to generate Samples. 

## Generating Documentation

A quick way to preview your documentation is to use [Speccy](https://speccy.io/).
Ensure you have installed Speccy globally and then you can use the following command.

```
speccy serve storage/app/v1_openapi.yaml
```
