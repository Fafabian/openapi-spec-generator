üôè Based upon initial prototype by [martianatwork](https://github.com/martianatwork), [glennjacobs](https://github.com/glennjacobs) and [byte-it](https://github.com/byte-it).

## Install

Via Composer
```
composer require swisnl/openapi-spec-generator
```

Publish the config file

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="LaravelJsonApi\OpenApiSpec\OpenApiServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

Generate the Open API spec
```
php artisan jsonapi:openapi:generate v1
```

Note that a seeded DB is required! The seeded data will be used to generate Samples.

### Descriptions

It's possible to add descriptions to your endpoints by implementing the DescribesEndpoints interface. The added method
receives the generated route name as a parameter. This can be used to generate descriptions for all your schema
endpoints.
``` php
class Post extends Schema implements DescribesEndpoints
{
    public function describeEndpoint(string $endpoint) {
        if ($endpoint === 'v1.posts.index') {
            return 'Description for index method';
        }
        
        return 'Default description';
    }
}
```

## Generating Documentation

A quick way to preview your documentation is to use [Speccy](https://speccy.io/).
Ensure you have installed Speccy globally and then you can use the following command.

```
speccy serve storage/app/v1_openapi.yaml
```
